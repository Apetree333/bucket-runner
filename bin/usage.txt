Usage: [options] <files or globs> -- [cmd] [{files} {partition}]

  Run [cmd] in using multiple processes, distributing the input files to
  each process.

  Files or globs can be any number of explicit files or shell escaped globs.

  Examples:

    $ bucket-runner 'files/*' # use built-in glob searching
    $ bucket-runner files/*   # rely on shell expansion

Options:

  --concurrency N          Use N concurrent processes, default: cpus * 4

  --partition-size N       Give N files to each process, default: 2

  --partition-regex N      Give N files to each process, default: 2.
                           Overrides partition-size if both are used.

  --no-resolve-files       Do not attempt to resolve the given files to
                           absolute paths, or determine if they exist.
                           This is useful when using this tool as a generic
                           argument runner.

  --continue-on-error      Continue, even if a command exits with a non-zero
                           code.

  --stream-output          Output stderr and stdout immediately, without
                           buffering.

If the strings `{files}` or `{partition}` are present in the command string,
they will be replaced with the files or the name of the partition (if using
a regex) respectively.

For example, the following are equivalent:

  $ bucket-runner files/* -- mocha {files}
  $ bucket-runner files/* -- mocha
